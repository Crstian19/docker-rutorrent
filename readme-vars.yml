  Webui can be found at `<your-ip>:80` , configuration files for rtorrent are in /config/rtorrent, php in config/php and for the webui in /config/rutorrent/settings.

  `Settings, changed by the user through the "Settings" panel in ruTorrent, are valid until rtorrent restart. After which all settings will be set according to the rtorrent config file (/config/rtorrent/rtorrent.rc),this is a limitation of the actual apps themselves.`

  ** Important note for unraid users or those running services such as a webserver on port 80, change port 80 assignment **

  `** It should also be noted that this container when run will create subfolders ,completed, incoming and watched in the /downloads volume.**`

  ** The Port Assignments and configuration folder structure has been changed from the previous ubuntu based versions of this container and we recommend a clean install **

  Umask can be set in the /config/rtorrent/rtorrent.rc file by changing value in `system.umask.set`

  If you are seeing this error `Caught internal_error: 'DhtRouter::get_tracker did not actually insert tracker.'.` , a possible fix is to disable dht in `/config/rtorrent/rtorrent.rc` by changing the following values.

  ```shell
  dht = disable
  peer_exchange = no
  ```

  If after updating you see an error about connecting to rtorrent in the webui,
  remove or comment out these lines in /config/rtorrent/rtorrent.rc ,whatever value is set, yes or no.
  Just setting them to no will still cause the error..

  ```
  use_udp_trackers = yes
  peer_exchange = yes
  ```
